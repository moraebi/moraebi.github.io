This is likely the last pre-release before releasing v0.4.0, which we plan on doing soon (i.e. before the end of the month) - very exciting! Some new additions to highlight: . | significant improvement on build time of navigation panel by @pdmosses . | this is big: for a community member with over 300 pages, we shortened the build time from 3 minutes to 30 seconds! | . | improved accessibility features led by @JPrevost | more docs! | . The intention of this release candidate is to gather even more feedback on a potential v0.4.0. As it stands, we have not encountered any breaking changes with early adopters of v0.4.0.rc1.

Simlar to the prior release, v0.4.0.rc2 is a release candidate for the theme (i.e., a pre-release) with release v0.4.0 coming soon. We want your help in testing the changes! As of now, the gem on RubyGems and the repository are updated to v0.4.0.rc2. To use this RC explicitly as a remote theme: . remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.4.0.rc2 .

By default, users will not be upgraded to 0.4.0.rc2. To enforce that explicitly, either: . | pin your gem version in your Gemfile, like so gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.3.3\" . | freeze the remote_theme, like so remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.3.3 . | .

    "content": "We’re back! . Hi all! The Just the Docs team is excited to have our first pre-release in over two years! It is jam-packed with features and bugfixes that have been requested by the community since 2020. They include: . | The new callouts component | Allowing pages and collections to coexist on the navigation pane | New styling: dark syntax highlighting, support for jekyll-asciidoc, word-wrapping instead of overflow for various elements | More customization: external nav links, custom nav footers, favicon includes, search color and placeholder configuration, mermaid.js support, and nav sorting | Over 20 bugfixes! Big ones include fixing the rake command, using relative_url, and search input color | More documentation, especially on using custom includes | Updating core dependencies to stable Ruby versions | A WIP template repository that allows you to setup your own repository using Just the Docs and GitHub Pages with one click - give it a shot! More documentation, etc. is on the way! | . We want your feedback! Are these changes helpful? Are our docs easy to understand? Should new features like mermaid be opt-in or opt-out? Please open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! . Trying out pre-release v0.4.0.rc1 . Due to the massive scope of these changes, we’re making v0.4.0.rc1 avaialble as a release candidate for the theme (i.e., a pre-release) with release v0.4.0 coming soon. We want your help in testing the changes! As of now, the gem on RubyGems and the repository are updated to v0.4.0.rc1. To use this RC explicitly as a remote theme: . remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.4.0.rc1 . To use this RC explicitly as a gem-based theme, pin the version in your Gemfile and re-run bundle install or bundle update just-the-docs: . gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.4.0.rc1\" . Staying on v0.3.3 . If you’re not ready to make the switch, that’s alright! If your version of just-the-docs is pinned to v0.3.3 (i.e. by a Gemfile.lock or in remote_theme, then there’s nothing you need to do. If you have not pinned your theme version, you should either: . | pin your gem version in your Gemfile, like so gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.3.3\" . | freeze the remote_theme, like so remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.3.3 . | . Use of branches for closed PRs (e.g., #466, #578) is now deprecated, as those branches have been (directly or indirectly) merged, and they may be deleted after the pre-release of v0.4.0.rc1. Maintenance . Internally, our maintainer team has expanded: Patrick Marsceill, the original maintainer, has stepped down from an active role after almost 4 years! We’re very thankful for the work that he’s done to create and maintain one of the most popular Jekyll themes. Please join us in giving him thanks! . The new core team currently consists of @mattxwang, @pdmosses, @skullface, @dougaitken, and @max06. Over the past six months, we’ve been triaging and merging in PRs, as well as contributing our own fixes. We’ll continue to address open issues, merge in PRs from the community, and plan out the future of Just the Docs. If you’d like to contribute, now is a great time! . Roadmap . In the short-term, we’re committed to tidying up everything for a v0.4.0 release. This involves fixing bugs reported from the community in this pre-release, as well as continually merging in minor PRs. We’re also scoping out medium and long-term projects, and want to keep you in the loop. These include: . | upgrading to Jekyll 4, and stopping support for Jekyll 3 | versioned docs - issue #728 | improved accessibility - issues #566, #870 | internationalization (i18n) - issue #59 | recursive/multi-level navigation - PR #462 | toggleable dark mode - issue #234 | . as well as DX improvements like better regression tests, CI, and tooling. If you’re interested in any of these, please join us on GitHub - any contribution (raising an issue, writing docs, or submitting a PR) is welcome! .

Additional configuration options are loaded through _includes/mermaid_config.js. By default, the contents of the file are the empty object: . // _includes/mermaid_config.js {} .

For example, to override the theme, change _includes/mermaid_config.js to: . // _includes/mermaid_config.js { theme: \"forest\" } . Once mermaid is installed, it can be used in markdown files. The markdown for a simple flowchart example might look like the following: . ```mermaid graph TD; A--&gt;B; A--&gt;C; B--&gt;D; C--&gt;D; ``` . which renders: . graph TD; A--&gt;B; A--&gt;C; B--&gt;D; C--&gt;D; .

    "content": "Define a custom scheme . You can add custom schemes. If you want to add a scheme named foo (can be any name) just add a file _sass/color_schemes/foo.scss (replace foo by your scheme name) where you override theme variables to change colors, fonts, spacing, etc. Since the default color scheme is light, your custom scheme is implicitly based on the variable settings used by the light scheme. If you want your custom scheme to be based on the dark scheme, you need to start your file with the following line: . @import \"./color_schemes/dark\"; . You can define custom schemes based on other custom schemes in the same way. Available variables are listed in the _variables.scss file. For example, to change the link color from the purple default to blue, include the following inside your scheme file: . Example . $link-color: $blue-000; . Keep in mind that changing a variable will not automatically change the value of other variables that depend on it. For example, the default link color ($link-color) is set to $purple-000. However, redefining $purple-000 in a custom color scheme will not automatically change $link-color to match it. Instead, each variable that relies on previously-cascaded values must be manually reimplemented by copying the dependent rules from _variables.scss — in this case, rewriting $link-color: $purple-000;. Note: Editing the variables directly in _sass/support/variables.scss is not recommended and can cause other dependencies to fail. Please use scheme files. Use a custom scheme . To use the custom color scheme, only set the color_scheme parameter in your site’s _config.yml file: . color_scheme: foo . Switchable custom scheme . If you want to be able to change the scheme dynamically, for example via javascript, just add a file assets/css/just-the-docs-foo.scss (replace foo by your scheme name) with the following content: . --- --- {% include css/just-the-docs.scss.liquid color_scheme=\"foo\" %} . This allows you to switch the scheme via the following javascript. jtd.setTheme(\"foo\") . ",

For example, if you’d like to add your own styles for printing a page, you could add the following styles.

To do this, create an _includes directory and make a copy of the specific file you wish to modify. The content in this file will override the theme defaults. You can learn more about this process in the Jekyll docs for Overriding theme defaults. Just the Docs provides the following custom includes files: . Custom TOC Heading . _includes/toc_heading_custom.html . If the page has any child pages, and has_toc is not set to false, this content appears as a heading above the auto-generating list of child pages after the page’s content. Example . To change the default TOC heading to “Contents”, create _includes/toc_heading_custom.html and add: . &lt;h2 class=\"text-delta\"&gt;Contents&lt;/h2&gt; . The (optional) text-delta class makes the heading appear as Contents . Custom Footer . _includes/footer_custom.html . This content appears at the bottom of every page’s main content. More info for this include can be found in the Configuration - Footer content. Custom Head . _includes/head_custom.html . Any HTML added to this file will be inserted before the closing &lt;head&gt; tag. This might include additional &lt;meta&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, or &lt;script&gt; tags. Example . To add a custom favicon, create _includes/head_custom.html and add: . &lt;link rel=\"shortcut icon\" type=\"image/png\" href=\"/just-the-docs/path/to/your/favicon.png\"&gt; . Custom Header . _includes/header_custom.html . Content added to this file appears at the top of every page’s main content between the site search and auxiliary links if they are enabled. If search_enabled were set to false and aux_links were removed, the content of header_custom.html would occupy the space at the top of every page. Custom Nav Footer . _includes/nav_footer_custom.html . Any content added to this file will appear at the bottom left of the page below the site’s navigation. By default an attribution to Just the Docs is displayed which reads, This site uses Just the Docs, a documentation theme for Jekyll.. Custom Search Placeholder . _includes/search_placeholder_custom.html . Content added to this file will replace the default placeholder text in the search bar (and its aria-label), after stripping HTML and leading/trailing whitespace. By default, the content of the include is: . Search {{site.title}} . Override this file to render a custom placeholder. One common use-case is internationalization; for example, .

The parameter values determine the order of the top-level pages, and of child pages with the same parent. You can reuse the same parameter values (e.g., integers starting from 1) for the child pages of different parents. The parameter values can be numbers (integers, floats) and/or strings. When you omit nav_order parameters, they default to the titles of the pages, which are ordered alphabetically. Pages with numerical nav_order parameters always come before those with strings or default nav_order parameters. If you want to make the page order independent of the page titles, you can set explicit nav_order parameters on all pages. By default, all Capital letters come before all lowercase letters; you can add nav_sort: case_insensitive in the configuration file to ignore the case. Enclosing strings in quotation marks is optional. Note for users of previous versions: nav_sort: case_insensitive previously affected the ordering of numerical nav_order parameters: e.g., 10 came before 2. Also, all pages with explicit nav_order parameters previously came before all pages with default parameters. Both were potentially confusing, and they have now been eliminated. ",

    "content": "Sometimes you will want to create a page with many children (a section). First, it is recommended that you keep pages that are related in a directory together… For example, in these docs, we keep all of the written documentation in the ./docs directory and each of the sections in subdirectories like ./docs/ui-components and ./docs/utilities. This gives us an organization like: . +-- .. |-- (Jekyll files) |-- docs |-- ui-components | |-- index.md (parent page) | |-- buttons.md | |-- code.md | |-- labels.md | |-- tables.md | +-- typography.md | |-- utilities | |-- index.md (parent page) | |-- color.md | |-- layout.md | |-- responsive-modifiers.md | +-- typography.md | |-- (other md files, pages with no children) | +-- .. |-- (Jekyll files) +-- .. On the parent pages, add this YAML front matter parameter: . | has_children: true (tells us that this is a parent page) | . Example . --- layout: default title: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true --- . Here we’re setting up the UI Components landing page that is available at /docs/ui-components, which has children and is ordered second in the main nav. Child pages . On child pages, simply set the parent: YAML front matter to whatever the parent’s page title is and set a nav order (this number is now scoped within the section). Example . --- layout: default title: Buttons parent: UI Components nav_order: 2 --- . The Buttons page appears as a child of UI Components and appears second in the UI Components section. Ordering child pages . You can optionally add the following to the YAML front matter to change the default sort order of child pages from ascending to descending order: . | child_nav_order: desc | . Example . --- layout: default title: Descending Child Pages child_nav_order: desc --- . Auto-generating Table of Contents . By default, all pages with children will automatically append a Table of Contents which lists the child pages after the parent page’s content. To disable this auto Table of Contents, set has_toc: false in the parent page’s YAML front matter. Example . --- layout: default title: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true has_toc: false --- . Children with children . Child pages can also have children (grandchildren). This is achieved by using a similar pattern on the child and grandchild pages. | Add the has_children attribute to the child | Add the parent and grand_parent attribute to the grandchild | . Example . --- layout: default title: Buttons parent: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true --- . --- layout: default title: Buttons Child Page parent: Buttons grand_parent: UI Components nav_order: 1 --- . This would create the following navigation structure: . +-- .. |-- UI Components |-- .. | |-- Buttons | |-- Button Child Page | |-- .. | +-- .. ",
